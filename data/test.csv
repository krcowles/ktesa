Bisti Badlands is considered to be one of the most scenic areas of  the southwest - rightfully so! Located about 40 miles south of Farmington off 371, access is provided by dirt road at a well-marked turn-off between mile markers 70 and 71.  The badlands is part of a vast wilderness area, and is loaded with bizarre and twisted rock sculptures, accentuated by a striking mix of color. Many of the more well-known features have been assigned interesting names, so it is well to plan in advance to see these, as the area has no trails and is open in every direction. Oftentimes the features are quite a distance apart.<br /><br />Be prepared, as the badlands is fully exposed to the sun, and carrying water, along with a reliable GPS unit, is advised. The best time to visit is in the fall, when summer's heat has faded. Winter can be brutal, and spring is often very windy in the southwest. It is difficult to present images that impart the solitude and vastness of the place, and photographing the scenes can be a challenge owing to the direct sun. Check out the photographic work in the references for an excellent and thoughtful presentation of hoodoo images at the badlands.","<li>Photo Essay: <em>Wonderland, A Photographer's Journey into the Bisti</em>, by Eduardo Fuss</li><li>Book: <em>100 Hikes In New Mexico</em>, by Craig Martin</li><li>Book: <em>New Mexico's Wilderness Areas</em>, by Bob Julyan</li><li>Book: <em>New Mexico Journey Guide</em>, by John Kramer &amp; Julie Martinez</li><li>Book: <em>Hiking New Mexico</em>, by Laurence Parent</li><li>Website: <a href=""http://www.americansouthwest.net/new_mexico/bisti_badlands/"" target=""_blank"">American Southwest</a></li><li>Website: <a href=""http://www.blm.gov/nm/st/en/prog/blm_special_areas/wilderness_and_wsas/wilderness_areas/bisti.html"" target=""_blank"">BLM Site</a></li><li>Website: <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bisti/De-Na-Zin_Wilderness"" target=""_blank"">Wikipeida</a></li><li>Website: <a href=""https://farmingtonnm.org/listings/bisti-de-na-zin-wilderness/"" target=""_blank"">FarmingtonNM.org</a></li><li>Blog: <a href=""http://www.thewave.info/BistiBadlandsCode/Map.html"" target=""_blank"">The Wave</a></li>","<div id=""proposed""><p id=""proptitle"">- Proposed Hike Data</p><ul id=""plinks""><li>Map: <a href=""../maps/BistiWestProposed.html"" target=""_blank"">Proposed Trail</a></li><li>GPX: <a href=""../gpx/BistiWestProposed.gpx"" target=""_blank"">Proposed Trail</a></li></ul></div>","<div id=""actual""><p id=""acttitle"">- Actual Hike Data</p><ul id=""alinks""><li>Map: <a href=""../maps/Bisti_geomap.html"" target=""_blank"">Actual Hike</a></li><li>GPX: <a href=""../gpx/Bisti.GPX"" target=""_blank"">Actual GPX</a></li></ul></div>"
