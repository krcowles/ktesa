Some of the longer hikes into the interior require permits and overnight camping in order to complete the hike. <p>Named after the archaeologist Adolph Bandelier, the park has worked diligently with the cooperation of the pueblo peoples of New Mexico. A very nice visitor center offers educational materials, sponsored walks, and also food. During the popular tourist time, from Mid-May to Mid-October, access is obtained via shuttle bus in nearby White Rock. From the visitor center, the primary ruins are within easy reach, as well as some pleasant trails. Unfortunately, the flood of 2011 radically altered the route to the falls, so that the Upper Falls trail no longer also provides access to the Lower Falls.

It is designated as a National Historic Park, and presumed to have been active between 1250 - 850 BC. There are many connected ruins and cultural sites both within the park and also extending outside its boundaries. Archeologists are beginning to better understand its historical and astrological significance, though a large number of questions remain. There have been numerous books written about Chaco Canyon, and some interesting DVD\'s which are well suited to the curious visitor. One of the better DVD\'s describing how numerous, very unique astronomical connections were discovered at Fajada Butte, is The Mystery of Chaco Canyon, narrated by Robert Redford.<p>\r\nChaco is rather remote, and requires significant travel to see it. It is more of an interesting archeological site than a place to hike, but most of the pueblo ruins at Chaco do require short loop walks of 1/4 to 1/2 mile, with longer loop hikes of over 3.5  miles. There is a trail of 7.4 miles, out and back, to reach Penasco Blanco, and just before approaching the Visitor Center, there is a trail that is about 3 miles (out and back) at Wijiji, which ends at a location where some Chacoan Rock Art can be viewed. Access to the canyon is generally dirt road, and if travelling from US 550, the 21-mile road in starts with about 7 miles of pavement. Another 7-8 miles is well-maintained gravel, but at that point, county maintenance ends, and the remainder - up to the interior paved park road - can be very rough and slow at best. A campsite on the park premises provides perhaps the best way to see Chaco, as it is 2-3 hours from Albuquerque, one way, and an overnight stay would help allow time to visit the many sites.</p>\r\n','2018-04-11',NULL,NULL,NULL),

Many of the lava flows are quite young by geological standards, such as McCarty\'s flow at Lava Falls, dated at 3,000 years or less. Older flows of about 115,000 years can be seen in the El Calderon area. Because of the lava features\' similarity to Hawaiian lava, many of the features bear Hawaiian names. In fact, El Malpais has been called \"the poor man\'s Hawaii\". <p>Because of its size, there are numerous activities in which to engage, some planned by the park service, and others available to the public year-round. In addition to the hikes and scenic drives (partly along the Continental Divide), there are petroglyphs, old homesteads, and other cultural sites to explore. Star-gazing events, lectures, and Solstice Walks have been sponsored by the Park Service. Back country drives are available in good weather, traversing the length of the park - these requiring four-wheel drive and sufficient ground clearance. When hiking in the park, some of the areas require great care due to the fact that the lava is very sharp and difficult to traverse, as well as having the characteristic that it can look the same in every direction, making it easy to get lost. A GPS system is advised, depending on where one is hiking.</p><p>El Malpais, located south of Grants, New Mexico, is bounded on the east by Highway 117, and on the north and west by Highway 53. Adjacent to El Malpais are the Zuni Mountains and also Mt. Taylor. Further travel on Highway 117 leads to El Morro National Monument.

There are occassional trail markers for Trail #137, some old and barely legible, but they rarely seem to appear at useful locations (branches, etc.). The trail begins with a lovely walk through an open Ponderosa forest, with interesting rock formations en route. Eventually, you begin to follow a dry gulley downhill to the <em>Jemez River</em>, where a footbridge crosses over it. The trail ascends sharply (a short distance) to the <em>Jemez Falls Picnic Area</em>. From there, you can make a 1/4 mile diversion to see the Falls - a very lovely view. <br /><br />137 heads west from the picnic area, where before long, a fantastic view of the valley is seen before a long descent down towards <em>Macauley Warm Springs</em>. The springs are about body temperature, and surrounded by tall beautiful ponderosas and wildflowers. A dip in the warm springs is almost essential! From the warm springs, it is about two miles to <em>Battleship Rock Picnic Area</em>, also on Highway 4 -- hence the need to make this a 2-car trip. From the warm springs, there are some lovely views of the valley and as you get closer, of<em> Battleship Rock</em>. The trail is lined with a phenomenal amount of obsidian - bolders, rocks, and small chunks, which make the final leg memorable. Most of the references cite only the portion between <em>Battleship Rock</em> and <em>Jemez Falls.</em></p>','2016-08-30',NULL,NULL,NULL),

It ascends at a very consistent grade, so although you do not need climbing gear, you may be surprised at the altitude you have traversed if you stop to catch your breath. Be careful &mdash; extremely fit 85 year olds may pass you while you are doing so. The most impressive part of the trail occurs when it passes and re-passes the fields of scree from some of the avalanches.
