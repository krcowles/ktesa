Check ahead and wear the proper gear.","While the Taos area has a great many hikes    available, one of the most popular is Williams Lake, accessed from a point near   the ski valley.  Although the trail is   designated as ""Easy"" in at least one of the hiking reference book, use caution in   assessing the climb, because it starts at almost 10,000 ft and ascends about 1200 ft   from there. If not acclimated to that altitude, hiking will proceed with more   difficulty. Nonetheless it is a beautiful location and the views can be   breath-taking.   From the Taos Ski Valley, a dirt road goes up to the trailhead, otherwise, if   hiking from the ski valley, significant distance and elevation will be added to   the hike.
