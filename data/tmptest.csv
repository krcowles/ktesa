National Monument has within its boundaries a great diversity of   geology and ancient cultural history. In its 50 square miles of territory,    situated on the Pajarito Plateau in the Jemez Mountains, many   trails penetrate not only the nearby ruins, but a variety of terrains with elevation   change of over 5,000 ft. Some of the longer hikes into the interior require   permits and overnight camping in order to complete the hike. <br><br>Named after the   archaeologist Adolph Bandelier,   the park has worked diligently with the cooperation of the pueblo peoples of New   Mexico. A very nice visitor center offers educational materials, sponsored walks, and   also food. During the popular tourist time, from Mid-May to Mid-October, access is   obtained via shuttle bus in nearby White Rock. From the visitor center, the primary   ruins are within easy reach, as well as some pleasant trails. Unfortunately, the   flood of 2011 radically altered the route to the falls, so that the Upper Falls   trail no longer also provides access to the Lower Falls.

Canyon, located in a desolate area of badlands in Northwest New Mexico,   is a world-reknowned archeological site, still connected with modern pueblo cultures.   Archeologists have now gathered enough information to better understand its   historical and astrological significance, though a large number of questions remain.   There have been numerous books written about Chaco Canyon, and some interesting   DVD's which are well suited to the curious visitor. One of the better DVD's   describing how numerous, very unique astronomical connections were discovered at   Fajada Butte, is   <em>The Mystery of Chaco Canyon</em>, narrated by Robert Redford.<br /><br />   Chaco is rather remote, and requires significant travel to see it. It is more   of an interesting archeological site than a place to hike, but most of the ""pueblos""   at Chaco do require short loop walks of 1/4 to 1/2 mile, with longer loop hikes   of over 4 miles (for the Pueblo Alto Loop), and about 3.6 miles (for the Tsin   Kletsin loop). There is a trail of 7.4 miles, out and back, to reach Penasco   Blanco, and just before approaching the Visitor Center, there is a trail that   is about 3 miles (out and back) at Wijiji, which ends at a location where some   Chacoan Rock Art can be viewed. Access to the canyon is generally   dirt road, and if travelling from US 550, the 21-mile road in starts with about 7 miles   of pavement. Another 7-8 miles is well-maintained gravel, but at that point, county   maintenance ends, and the remainder - up to the interior paved park road - can be   very rough and slow at best. A campsite on the park premises provides perhaps the   best way to see Chaco, as it is 2-1/2 hours from Corrales, one way, and an   overnight stay would help allow time to visit the many sites.<br /><br />   The authors have not yet completed visits to all the sites. Nonetheless, the   sites available in the park are listed below in a table. The sites not yet visited   are identified by gray text.

Malpais is a vast area (590 square miles!) in western New Mexico, replete   with lava fields, tubes, caves and other volcanic features. Many of the lava flows   are quite young by geological standards, such as McCarty's flow at Lava Falls,   dated at 3,000 years or less. Older flows of about 115,000 years can be seen in the   El Calderon area. Because of the lava features' similarity to Hawaiian lava,   many of the features bear Hawaiian names. In fact, El Malpais has been called   ""the poor man's Hawaii"". Because of its   size, there are numerous activities in which to engage, some planned by the park   service, and others available to the public year-round. In addition to the hikes   and scenic drives (partly along the Continental Divide), there are petroglyphs,   old homesteads, and other cultural sites to explore. Star-gazing events, lectures,   and Solstice Walks have been sponsored by the Park Service. Back country drives   are available in good weather, traversing the length of the park - these requiring   four-wheel drive and sufficient ground clearance.<br /><br />   El Malpais, located south   of Grants, New Mexico, is bounded on the east by Highway 117, and on the north and   west by Highway 53. Adjacent to El Malpais are the Zuni Mountains and also Mt.   Taylor. Further travel on Highway 117 leads to El Morro National Monument. West of   the badlands is Ramah Navajo reservation land, and on the east, Acoma reservation   land.<br /><br />   Because of the numerous hikes available in the park, a list is provided below   from which to select and view the options - many of which the authors have not   yet attempted. As the authors learn more about the area, additional entries to   the table will be provided, including homestead and petroglyph hikes. The current   index is far from comprehensive!   Some of the areas require great care due to the fact that the lava   is very sharp and difficult to traverse, as well as having the characteristic   that it can look the same in every direction, making it easy to get lost. A   GPS system would be advised, depending on where one is hiking. Travel time from   Corrales is a bit more than 1-1/2 hours, or more, depending on which part of the   park is being visited.",0,,

National Park in Albuquerque covers numerous sites containing   a large number of ancient petroglyphs (""Rio Grande"" style), as well as   encompassing the Albuquerque Volcanoes. There are three areas where one can   see the petroglyphs up close, as well as a very nicely maintained Visitor Center   just north of the Rinconada site. At the Visitor Center, there are numerous books,   lectures and DVD's about the origin and nature of the petroglpyphs, as well as   a short film. While all of the sites are popular with visitors, the most popular   is probably Boca Raton, which has shorter walks available with numerous petroglyphs.   Rinconada Canyon was flooded out in 2013 and the trail is still roped off en route   and the petroglyphs cannot easily be approached. All sites are nonetheless well   worth a visit.<br /><br />   The Albuquerque Volcanoes can be seen from most of the city, situated on the   west mesa. The most prominent have been labeled ""The Three Sisters"". A trail   connects these three from the parking lot, and the northernmost two are viewed   from the third volcano on the trail, Vulcan. The volcanoes are located further   from the city than the Petroglyphs sites.<br /><br />   The authors have completed visits to all the sites, with one lesser used trail   yet untraveled. The   sites available in the park are listed below in a table. The site not yet visited   is identified by gray text. Links are provided to pages with some photos and   a bit more information about each site.",0,,

National Monument has within its boundaries a great diversity of   geology and ancient cultural history. In its 50 square miles of territory,    situated on the Pajarito Plateau in the Jemez Mountains, many   trails penetrate not only the nearby ruins, but a variety of terrains with elevation   change of over 5,000 ft. Some of the longer hikes into the interior require   permits and overnight camping in order to complete the hike. <br><br>Named after the   archaeologist Adolph Bandelier,   the park has worked diligently with the cooperation of the pueblo peoples of New   Mexico. A very nice visitor center offers educational materials, sponsored walks, and   also food. During the popular tourist time, from Mid-May to Mid-October, access is   obtained via shuttle bus in nearby White Rock. From the visitor center, the primary   ruins are within easy reach, as well as some pleasant trails. Unfortunately, the   flood of 2011 radically altered the route to the falls, so that the Upper Falls   trail no longer also provides access to the Lower Falls.

Canyon, located in a desolate area of badlands in Northwest New Mexico,   is a world-reknowned archeological site, still connected with modern pueblo cultures.   Archeologists have now gathered enough information to better understand its   historical and astrological significance, though a large number of questions remain.   There have been numerous books written about Chaco Canyon, and some interesting   DVD's which are well suited to the curious visitor. One of the better DVD's   describing how numerous, very unique astronomical connections were discovered at   Fajada Butte, is   <em>The Mystery of Chaco Canyon</em>, narrated by Robert Redford.<br /><br />   Chaco is rather remote, and requires significant travel to see it. It is more   of an interesting archeological site than a place to hike, but most of the ""pueblos""   at Chaco do require short loop walks of 1/4 to 1/2 mile, with longer loop hikes   of over 4 miles (for the Pueblo Alto Loop), and about 3.6 miles (for the Tsin   Kletsin loop). There is a trail of 7.4 miles, out and back, to reach Penasco   Blanco, and just before approaching the Visitor Center, there is a trail that   is about 3 miles (out and back) at Wijiji, which ends at a location where some   Chacoan Rock Art can be viewed. Access to the canyon is generally   dirt road, and if travelling from US 550, the 21-mile road in starts with about 7 miles   of pavement. Another 7-8 miles is well-maintained gravel, but at that point, county   maintenance ends, and the remainder - up to the interior paved park road - can be   very rough and slow at best. A campsite on the park premises provides perhaps the   best way to see Chaco, as it is 2-1/2 hours from Corrales, one way, and an   overnight stay would help allow time to visit the many sites.<br /><br />   The authors have not yet completed visits to all the sites. Nonetheless, the   sites available in the park are listed below in a table. The sites not yet visited   are identified by gray text.

Malpais is a vast area (590 square miles!) in western New Mexico, replete   with lava fields, tubes, caves and other volcanic features. Many of the lava flows   are quite young by geological standards, such as McCarty's flow at Lava Falls,   dated at 3,000 years or less. Older flows of about 115,000 years can be seen in the   El Calderon area. Because of the lava features' similarity to Hawaiian lava,   many of the features bear Hawaiian names. In fact, El Malpais has been called   ""the poor man's Hawaii"". Because of its   size, there are numerous activities in which to engage, some planned by the park   service, and others available to the public year-round. In addition to the hikes   and scenic drives (partly along the Continental Divide), there are petroglyphs,   old homesteads, and other cultural sites to explore. Star-gazing events, lectures,   and Solstice Walks have been sponsored by the Park Service. Back country drives   are available in good weather, traversing the length of the park - these requiring   four-wheel drive and sufficient ground clearance.<br /><br />   El Malpais, located south   of Grants, New Mexico, is bounded on the east by Highway 117, and on the north and   west by Highway 53. Adjacent to El Malpais are the Zuni Mountains and also Mt.   Taylor. Further travel on Highway 117 leads to El Morro National Monument. West of   the badlands is Ramah Navajo reservation land, and on the east, Acoma reservation   land.<br /><br />   Because of the numerous hikes available in the park, a list is provided below   from which to select and view the options - many of which the authors have not   yet attempted. As the authors learn more about the area, additional entries to   the table will be provided, including homestead and petroglyph hikes. The current   index is far from comprehensive!   Some of the areas require great care due to the fact that the lava   is very sharp and difficult to traverse, as well as having the characteristic   that it can look the same in every direction, making it easy to get lost. A   GPS system would be advised, depending on where one is hiking. Travel time from   Corrales is a bit more than 1-1/2 hours, or more, depending on which part of the   park is being visited.",0,,

National Park in Albuquerque covers numerous sites containing   a large number of ancient petroglyphs (""Rio Grande"" style), as well as   encompassing the Albuquerque Volcanoes. There are three areas where one can   see the petroglyphs up close, as well as a very nicely maintained Visitor Center   just north of the Rinconada site. At the Visitor Center, there are numerous books,   lectures and DVD's about the origin and nature of the petroglpyphs, as well as   a short film. While all of the sites are popular with visitors, the most popular   is probably Boca Raton, which has shorter walks available with numerous petroglyphs.   Rinconada Canyon was flooded out in 2013 and the trail is still roped off en route   and the petroglyphs cannot easily be approached. All sites are nonetheless well   worth a visit.<br /><br />   The Albuquerque Volcanoes can be seen from most of the city, situated on the   west mesa. The most prominent have been labeled ""The Three Sisters"". A trail   connects these three from the parking lot, and the northernmost two are viewed   from the third volcano on the trail, Vulcan. The volcanoes are located further   from the city than the Petroglyphs sites.<br /><br />   The authors have completed visits to all the sites, with one lesser used trail   yet untraveled. The   sites available in the park are listed below in a table. The site not yet visited   is identified by gray text. Links are provided to pages with some photos and   a bit more information about each site.",0,,

National Monument has within its boundaries a great diversity of   geology and ancient cultural history. In its 50 square miles of territory,    situated on the Pajarito Plateau in the Jemez Mountains, many   trails penetrate not only the nearby ruins, but a variety of terrains with elevation   change of over 5,000 ft. Some of the longer hikes into the interior require   permits and overnight camping in order to complete the hike. <br><br>Named after the   archaeologist Adolph Bandelier,   the park has worked diligently with the cooperation of the pueblo peoples of New   Mexico. A very nice visitor center offers educational materials, sponsored walks, and   also food. During the popular tourist time, from Mid-May to Mid-October, access is   obtained via shuttle bus in nearby White Rock. From the visitor center, the primary   ruins are within easy reach, as well as some pleasant trails. Unfortunately, the   flood of 2011 radically altered the route to the falls, so that the Upper Falls   trail no longer also provides access to the Lower Falls.

Canyon, located in a desolate area of badlands in Northwest New Mexico,   is a world-reknowned archeological site, still connected with modern pueblo cultures.   Archeologists have now gathered enough information to better understand its   historical and astrological significance, though a large number of questions remain.   There have been numerous books written about Chaco Canyon, and some interesting   DVD's which are well suited to the curious visitor. One of the better DVD's   describing how numerous, very unique astronomical connections were discovered at   Fajada Butte, is   <em>The Mystery of Chaco Canyon</em>, narrated by Robert Redford.<br /><br />   Chaco is rather remote, and requires significant travel to see it. It is more   of an interesting archeological site than a place to hike, but most of the ""pueblos""   at Chaco do require short loop walks of 1/4 to 1/2 mile, with longer loop hikes   of over 4 miles (for the Pueblo Alto Loop), and about 3.6 miles (for the Tsin   Kletsin loop). There is a trail of 7.4 miles, out and back, to reach Penasco   Blanco, and just before approaching the Visitor Center, there is a trail that   is about 3 miles (out and back) at Wijiji, which ends at a location where some   Chacoan Rock Art can be viewed. Access to the canyon is generally   dirt road, and if travelling from US 550, the 21-mile road in starts with about 7 miles   of pavement. Another 7-8 miles is well-maintained gravel, but at that point, county   maintenance ends, and the remainder - up to the interior paved park road - can be   very rough and slow at best. A campsite on the park premises provides perhaps the   best way to see Chaco, as it is 2-1/2 hours from Corrales, one way, and an   overnight stay would help allow time to visit the many sites.<br /><br />   The authors have not yet completed visits to all the sites. Nonetheless, the   sites available in the park are listed below in a table. The sites not yet visited   are identified by gray text.

Malpais is a vast area (590 square miles!) in western New Mexico, replete   with lava fields, tubes, caves and other volcanic features. Many of the lava flows   are quite young by geological standards, such as McCarty's flow at Lava Falls,   dated at 3,000 years or less. Older flows of about 115,000 years can be seen in the   El Calderon area. Because of the lava features' similarity to Hawaiian lava,   many of the features bear Hawaiian names. In fact, El Malpais has been called   ""the poor man's Hawaii"". Because of its   size, there are numerous activities in which to engage, some planned by the park   service, and others available to the public year-round. In addition to the hikes   and scenic drives (partly along the Continental Divide), there are petroglyphs,   old homesteads, and other cultural sites to explore. Star-gazing events, lectures,   and Solstice Walks have been sponsored by the Park Service. Back country drives   are available in good weather, traversing the length of the park - these requiring   four-wheel drive and sufficient ground clearance.<br /><br />   El Malpais, located south   of Grants, New Mexico, is bounded on the east by Highway 117, and on the north and   west by Highway 53. Adjacent to El Malpais are the Zuni Mountains and also Mt.   Taylor. Further travel on Highway 117 leads to El Morro National Monument. West of   the badlands is Ramah Navajo reservation land, and on the east, Acoma reservation   land.<br /><br />   Because of the numerous hikes available in the park, a list is provided below   from which to select and view the options - many of which the authors have not   yet attempted. As the authors learn more about the area, additional entries to   the table will be provided, including homestead and petroglyph hikes. The current   index is far from comprehensive!   Some of the areas require great care due to the fact that the lava   is very sharp and difficult to traverse, as well as having the characteristic   that it can look the same in every direction, making it easy to get lost. A   GPS system would be advised, depending on where one is hiking. Travel time from   Corrales is a bit more than 1-1/2 hours, or more, depending on which part of the   park is being visited.",0,,

National Park in Albuquerque covers numerous sites containing   a large number of ancient petroglyphs (""Rio Grande"" style), as well as   encompassing the Albuquerque Volcanoes. There are three areas where one can   see the petroglyphs up close, as well as a very nicely maintained Visitor Center   just north of the Rinconada site. At the Visitor Center, there are numerous books,   lectures and DVD's about the origin and nature of the petroglpyphs, as well as   a short film. While all of the sites are popular with visitors, the most popular   is probably Boca Raton, which has shorter walks available with numerous petroglyphs.   Rinconada Canyon was flooded out in 2013 and the trail is still roped off en route   and the petroglyphs cannot easily be approached. All sites are nonetheless well   worth a visit.<br /><br />   The Albuquerque Volcanoes can be seen from most of the city, situated on the   west mesa. The most prominent have been labeled ""The Three Sisters"". A trail   connects these three from the parking lot, and the northernmost two are viewed   from the third volcano on the trail, Vulcan. The volcanoes are located further   from the city than the Petroglyphs sites.<br /><br />   The authors have completed visits to all the sites, with one lesser used trail   yet untraveled. The   sites available in the park are listed below in a table. The site not yet visited   is identified by gray text. Links are provided to pages with some photos and   a bit more information about each site.",0,,
