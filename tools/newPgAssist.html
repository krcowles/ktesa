<div class="bodyBox">
	<p>This 'new page assist' html file, with its accompanying javascript, will
	dynamically load and size user-selected images to fit into a row of
	specified height (the default for height, if not increased during row
	optimization, is 260px - if a different "seed" height is desired, change the
	var 'rowHeight' near the top of the javascript file). 
	The images will fill a row of 'rowLineWidth (specified in
	the accompanying CSS file 'body' element - it is best to leave this as is
	to ensure consistency across sites). The specification of photo images
	begins immediately after the 'p id="page_title"'.
	<strong>FIRST:</strong> specify the Flickr "name" of the photo(s) you wish
	to be displayed into the set of consecutive "li" elements (div id="theRows"). 
	<em>NOTE: the names must be an EXACT MATCH, case sensitive, to the 
	name appearing in the Flickr ablum. NO OTHER LIST ELEMENTS can be present
	in this html</em> Also note that there are no "jpg" suffixes on the names.
	<strong>SECOND:</strong> specify the geo-map to be used
	for the iframe into a "p" element, id="frm_name". It is preferred to use one
	with track and marker lists turned off. <strong>THIRD:</strong>
	specify the GPSVinput.tsv file name to be associated with this page (to be
	processed by javascript) in the 'p' element id="tsv_file". For example,
	the Flickr album "Ancho Rapids" whas a corresponding GPSVinput.tsv file,
	named Ancho.tsv. <strong>NEW OPTION:</strong>If an elevation graph is to be
	included, type "YES" in the 'p id="inclElev"' element and populate the
	'p id="egraph"' element with the file (presumably .jpg will be used). Type
	"NO" otherwise and leave the egraph empty.
	That's it - save and execute! A text file will be created
	which can be cut and pasted into the page template. The template CSS file
	will center the images and iframe on the page, provide pop-up descriptions,
	and links to the album(s) and/or geomap.</p>
