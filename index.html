	<div id="intro">
		<p>The intention of this site is to provide you, the viewer, a look at 
		a variety of hikes, all undertaken by the authors in <em>The Land of 
		Enchantment</em>. These hikes cover a broad, cross-state array of
		possibilities, all found in the diverse terrain of New Mexico - from short
		treks, to longer, uphill/downhill ascents.
		</p> 
	</div> <!-- end of intro -->
	<div id="features">
		<p>One of the features of this site 
		is that not all of the hikes listed can be found in popular hiking books, or 
		even in on-line trail apps. Check out the interactive features:</p>
	</div> <!-- end of 'features' -->
	<p id="expect">WHAT YOU WILL SEE:</p>
	<div id="expl">
		<p>
		   Each of the selections below will take you to an interactive
		   Google map with marker pins denoting locations of the various New Mexico hikes
		   undertaken by the authors
		</p>
		<p><em id="itals">As you zoom in and 
		   pan to different locations</em>, the table of hikes below the map will list only
		   those hikes that 
		   can currently be seen on the map. Clicking on a map marker pin will produce a
		   pop-up with information pertinent to the hike, and a link to the website.
		</p>
		<p>When multiple hikes share the same trailhead, the marker shows up 
		   as a blue pin; Locations of park Visitor's Centers are indicated by green pins.

			with no table. When you choose <span class="btxt">'Map + Table'</span>, you will
			still see the map, and also be able to choose a
			hike from a table, where additional useful hike 
			information is presented. From there, you can click on the specific hike website, 
			or go to the hike's corresponding Flickr album.
			The tables also have sort capability, so that the table sorts in ascending,
			then descending order, with successive clicks.  Click on a hike and see what
			awaits you!

	<div id="disclaimers">A number of the
		hikes occurred before the authors' acquisition of a GPS system, and hence
		will not have geomaps available to view. In those cases, a static map will
		be provided.
		Furthermore, some of the hikes occurred prior to certain environmental changes
		which have rendered them no longer accessible, or accessible only in modified
		form. Primarily:
			<ul id="disasters">
				<li> Fires: Cerro Grande (Los Alamos, 2000); Los Conchas (Valles Caldera,
				2011); Gila (2012); Dog Head (Monzano Mtns, 2016)</li>
				<li> Floods: Bandelier (2011); Rinconada Canyon (2013)</li>
				<li> Volcanoes & Earthquakes: we hope not!</li>
			</ul>
