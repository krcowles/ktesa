	<div id="intro">
		<p>The intention of this site is to provide you, the viewer, a look at 
		a variety of hikes, all undertaken by the authors in <em>The Land of 
		Enchantment</em>. These hikes cover a broad, cross-state array of
		possibilities, all found in the diverse terrain of New Mexico - from short
		treks, to longer, uphill/downhill ascents.
		</p> 
	</div> <!-- end of intro -->
	<div id="features">
		<p>One of the features of this site 
		is that not all of the hikes listed can be found in popular hiking books, or 
		even in on-line trail apps. Check out the interactive features:</p>
	</div> <!-- end of 'features' -->
	<p id="expect">WHAT YOU WILL SEE:</p>
	<div id="expl">
		<p>
		   Each of the selections below will take you to an interactive
		   Google map with marker pins denoting locations of the various New Mexico hikes
		   undertaken by the authors
		</p>
		<p>
			Depending on your selection you will see either a full-page map (only), or
			a large map with an interactive 'table of hikes' below. Geolocation will
			allow you to display and update your location on the map.

			<p>Map features (both Full-Page and Map-With-Table):</p>
			<ul class="dashed">
				<li>Maps are standard Google maps, which allow pan, zoom and full-screen
					display.</li>
				<li>Marker pins display "info-windows" when clicked, showing hike
					details, and containing links to the corresponding website and
					directions to the location of the hike.</li>
				<li>When zoomed in sufficiently, tracks indicating the trail or path
					the authors took will display, with arrows indicating
					the direction the authors traveled.</li>
				<li>Green marker pins indicate Visitor Center locations for National
					Parks and Monuments.</li>
				<li>Blue pins indicate trailheads where multiple hikes begin. When
					clicking on a blue pin, all hikes are shown with their corresponding
					links, and one link to the common trailhead.</li>
				<li>Red pins represent all other hikes</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Table features:</p>
			<ul class="dashed">	
				<li>The list is intended to provide a brief summary of hike statistics,
					and also links to the corresponding website, google directions, or
					that hike's Flickr album.</li>
				<li>The starting  list of hikes is not sorted in any particular order, but
					clicking on a column header allows alphabetical (or numerical) sorting.
					The first click will sort in ascending order, each successive click
					will reverse the sort order.</li>
				<li><em id="itals">As you zoom in and/or pan to different locations</em>,
					the table of hikes below the map will list only those hikes that can 
					currently be seen on the map. </li>
				<li>As you move your mouse over different rows, that row will be highlighted
					for easy reference.</li>
			</ul>
			<div id="disclaimers">A number of the
				hikes occurred before the authors' acquisition of a GPS system, and hence
				will not have geomaps available to view. In those cases, a static map will
				be provided.
				Furthermore, some of the hikes occurred prior to certain environmental changes
				which have rendered them no longer accessible, or accessible only in modified
				form. Primarily:
					<ul id="disasters">
						<li> Fires: Cerro Grande (Los Alamos, 2000); Los Conchas (Valles Caldera,
						2011); Gila (2012); Dog Head (Monzano Mtns, 2016)</li>
						<li> Floods: Bandelier (2011); Rinconada Canyon (2013)</li>
						<li> Volcanoes & Earthquakes: we hope not!</li>
					</ul>

			<div id="linkNote">
				<em>Note: All of the links on this site (denoted by check-boxes) will open new
				windows (or tabs)</em>. The corresponding web pages ("Info Web Pages") provide sample
				pictures, trail descriptions, maps or tracks, and links to related materials.

				corresponding Flickr symbol in the table
