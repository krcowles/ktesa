    Adventures!</strong>
    </p>
    <div id="intro">
        <p>The intention of this site is to provide you, the viewer, a look at 
        a variety of hikes, all undertaken by the authors in <em>The Land of 
        Enchantment</em>. These hikes cover a broad, cross-state array of
        possibilities, all found in the diverse terrain of New Mexico - from short
        treks, to longer, uphill/downhill ascents.
        </p> 
    </div> <!-- end of intro -->
    <div id="features">
        <p>One of the features of this site 
        is that not all of the hikes listed can be found in popular hiking books, or 
        even in on-line trail apps. Check out the interactive features:</p>

        Each of the selections below will take you to an interactive
        Google map with marker pins denoting locations of the various New Mexico hikes
        undertaken by the authors
        </p>
        <p>
        Depending on your selection you will see either a full-page map (only), or
        a large map with an interactive 'table of hikes' below. Geolocation will
        allow you to display and update your location on the map.

            <ul class="dashed">
                <li>Maps are standard Google maps, which allow pan, zoom and full-screen
                        display.</li>
                <li>Marker pins display "info-windows" when clicked, showing hike
                        details, and containing links to the corresponding website and
                        directions to the location of the hike.</li>
                <li>When zoomed in sufficiently, tracks indicating the trail or path
                        the authors took will display, with arrows indicating
                        the direction the authors traveled.</li>
                <li>Yellow marker pins indicate Visitor Center locations for National or
                        State Parks and Monuments, or other public/private information center
                        buildings (e.g. Ghost Ranch). These markers may also contain a list
                        of hikes, when the hikes begin at the center.</li>
                <li>Blue pins indicate trailheads where multiple hikes begin. When
                        clicking on a blue pin, all hikes are shown with their corresponding
                        links, and one link to the common trailhead.</li>
                <li>Red pins represent all other hikes, and will show hike stats and
                        trailhead links.</li>

            <p>Table features:</p>
            <ul class="dashed">	
                <li>The table of hikes is intended to provide a brief summary of hike statistics,
                        and also links to the corresponding website, google directions, or
                        that hike's Flickr album.</li>
                <li>The table of hikes initially displayed is not sorted in any particular order, but
                        clicking on a column header allows alphabetical (or numerical) sorting.
                        The first click will sort in ascending order, each successive click
                        will reverse the sort order.</li>

                        the table of hikes below the map will list only those hikes that can 
                        currently be seen on the map. </li>
                <li>As you move your mouse over different rows, that row will be highlighted
                        for easy reference.</li>

            <p id="disclaimers">A number of the
                hikes occurred before the authors' acquisition of a GPS system, and hence
                will not have geomaps available to view. In those cases, a static map will
                be provided.
                Furthermore, some of the hikes occurred prior to certain environmental changes
                which have rendered them no longer accessible, or accessible only in modified
                form. Primarily: </p>
