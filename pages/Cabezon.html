		<p id="hikeInfo">Cabezon Peak is a volcanic "neck" - the remnants 
		of a volcano whose exterior has eroded away. It is located in a Wilderness Study
		Area and is maintained by the BLM. Access is secured by travelling west from US 550
		towards San Luis, and then on dirt roads to the trailhead, which is clearly marked.
		The road to the parking area is quite rough and requires a vehicle with sufficient
		ground clearance. From the parking area, the trail immediately ascends the steep
		slope towards the peak itself. From the top of the slope, and en route, there are
		numerous fine views. For more historical and general information about Cabezon,
		visit the
		<a href="http://www.blm.gov/nm/st/en/prog/recreation/rio_puerco/cabezon_peak.html" target="_blank">
		BLM Site</a>. Allegedly, one can reach the very top of the peak, however the author
		discovered that it is a treacherous slope of loose rock and requires significant
		skill. Ropes or other climbing accessories would be helpful. </p>
