		<p id="tipHdr">TRAIL TIPS!</p>
		<p id="tipNotes">The East Fork trail has some unmarkerd forks - beware! At the 
		trailhead near Highway 4, a trail cuts across this trail (#137) running mostly
		parallel to NM 4 - the sign at the trailhead makes it pretty clear which way to go
		(away from the road). However, about a mile later, the trail appears to split off
		to the right, up and over a rise. This looks to be the more well-traveled route,
		but keep going straight, following the gulley.
		Also, shortly after leaving the Jemez Falls picnic grounds, in about a half-mile,
		a more obvious path to the left affords some really great views of the Jemez
		valley, while 137 goes downhill. The views at the overlook are well worth it,
		and it is a short diversion.</p>
		</div>
		<p id="hikeInfo">The East Fork trailhead starts on Highway 4, as does the
		hike toward Las Conchas, but cross the road and head south to start this one.
		There are occassional trail markers for Trail #137, some old and barely legible,
		but they rarely seem to appear at useful locations (branches, etc.). The trail
		begins with a lovely walk through an open Ponderosa forest, with interesting
		rock formations en route. Eventually, you begin to follow a dry gulley downhill to
		the Jemez River, where a footbridge crosses over it. The trail ascends sharply
		(a short distance) to the Jemez Falls Picnic Area. From there, you can make
		a 1/4 mile diversion to see the Falls - a very lovely view. 137 heads west from the
		picnic area, where before long, 
		a fantastic view of the valley is seen before a long descent down towards Macauley
		Warm Springs. The springs are about body temperature, and surrounded by tall
		beautiful ponderosas and wildflowers. A dip in the warm springs is almost essential!
		From the warm springs, it is about two miles to Battleship Rock Picnic Area, also
		on Highway 4 -- hence the need to make this a 2-car trip. From the warm springs,
		there are some lovely views of the valley and as you get closer, Battleship Rock.
		The trail is lined with a phenomenal amount of obsidian - bolders, rocks, and
		small chunks, which make the final leg memorable.</p>
