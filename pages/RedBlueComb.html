		<p id="hikeInfo" class="grid_16">Both the Red Dot and the Blue Dot Trails have their
		   trailheads in White Rock, NM, on the rim of Pajarito Canyon. At the bottom,
		   their is a connecting trail called the River Trail, which parallels the
		   Rio Grande, and joins the Red Dot to the Blue Dot. The Red Dot seems to be
		   a bit steeper than the Blue Dot, and when making the loop, the Red Dot seems
		   a better starting point. The loop can be joined on the rim with another
		   interconnecting trail, or if there are two cars available, park one at each
		   trailhead for a shorter overall hike. The Red Dot to River Trail to Blue Dot
		   loop through the canyon is about 4.4 miles in length [web ref: 
		   <a href="https://www.losalamosnm.us/parks/trails/Pages/BlueDotRedDotLoop.aspx"
		   target="_blank">Los Alamos Trails</a>; hiking books: <cite>Day Hikes in the 
		   Santa Fe Area</cite>, by the Sierra Club; <cite>Hiking New Mexico</cite>,
		   by Laurence Parent ]. One of the pleasant features of this hike is the 
		   appearance of water features along Pajarito Spring: quiet pools, small
		   waterfalls, etc. - depending on time of year. Photos of Pajarito Canyon taken 
		   from the loop hike are available
