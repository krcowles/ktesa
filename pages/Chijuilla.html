		<p id="hikeInfo" class="grid_16">Mesa Chijuilla is one of five fascinating mesas
		located near Cuba, Nm - a part of the San Juan Basin badlands. None of the areas
		have designated trails, but there is so much interesting terrain to explore, it
		doesn't matter. This mesa is the second one west of US550, and parking is secured
		wherever there is adequate space. There is a proliferation of hoodoos, cliffs, 
		and mesa tops to see. If hiking a significant distance from the car, a GPS system
		would be advised, as the terrain twists and turns, and the geological features
		can easily block the view back. The area is described in <em>New Mexico Magazine</em>
		November, 2013 issue, and contains maps and directions to all five points of 
		interest. Online, a good site to visit is the 
		<a href="http://www.americansouthwest.net/new_mexico/san-juan-basin/badlands.html" target="_blank">
		San Juan Badlands site</a>, which features pictures and information about the area.
