		<p id="hikeInfo" class="grid_16">To get to the Big Tubes area, a four-wheel drive
		is recommended, as the road (between gradings) can be quite rough. It is impassable
		in wet or snowy weather. While CR 42 is in relatively good shape, roads diverging
		from it can be pitted, rutted and otherwise tricky.The Big Tubes area is loaded
		with collapsed
		lava tubes and lava bridges, but the walk/hike is arduous owing to the angular,
		cutting lava field - which also looks virtually the same in every direction, once
		the hiker enters the field. Although large cairns of lava rock are piled high to
		mark the way, if you diverge from the trail, it is very easy to get lost, as the
		author once did! There is no cell service in the location, it is exposed to full
		sun all day, and numerous flies and other insects are present. The features are
		very striking, but it would be wise to carry GPS along with water. The collapsed
		lava tubes are quite large and extensive in the area, and the resulting bridges
		are intriguing, though hard to photograph due to the shadows and contrast in the
		area. While the NPS site does not
		provide much coverage other than photos, check out the 
		<a href="http://www.americansouthwest.net/new_mexico/el_malpais_lavabeds/big-tubes.html" target="-blank">
		American Southwest link</a> which does a better job.</p>
