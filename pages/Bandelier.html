		<p>Bandelier National Monument has within its boundaries a great diversity of
		geology and ancient cultural history. In its 50 square miles of territory, 
		situated on the Pajarito Plateau in the Jemez Mountains, many
		trails penetrate not only the nearby ruins, but a variety of terrains with elevation
		change of over 5,000 ft. Some of the longer hikes into the interior require
		permits and overnight camping. Named after an archaeologist named Adolph Bandelier,
		the park has worked diligently with the cooperation of the pueblo peoples of New
		Mexico. A very nice visitor center offers educational materials, sponsored walks, and
		also food. During the popular tourist time, from Mid-May to Mid-October, access is
		obtained via shuttle bus in nearby White Rock. From the visitor center, the primary
		ruins are within easy reach, as well as some pleasant trails. Unfortunately, the
		flood of 2011 radically altered the route to the falls, so that the Upper Falls
		trail no longer also provides access to the Lower Falls. The latest park information
		can always be found on the  
		<a href="https://www.nps.gov/band/index.htm" target="_blank">NPS site</a>. Check 
		that site for any pending alerts or other messages prior to your visit.
