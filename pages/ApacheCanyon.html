		<p id="hikeInfo" class="grid_16">The Apache Canyon Trail begins as a branch off of
		Forest Road Forest Road 79, East of Santa Fe. From here, the trail proceeds sometimes
		as a trail and sometimes as a dirt road, providing beautiful glimpses into the 
		Sangre de Cristo Mountains. When it reaches the canyon, it drops quite steeply down
		to the creek, then back up (steeply!). Most of the trail is easy, and the steep
		parts are at least not long. There are references online to a battle having to do
		with Apache Canyon (Glorietta Pass), but it is not clear that the hike is in the
		same area. Detailed trail instructions and travel routes are provided by the
		<em>Day Hikes In The Santa Fe Area</em> book by the Northern New Mexico Group of
		the Sierra Club. Otherwise, most online reference address the battle.</p>
