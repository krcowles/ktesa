		<p>El Malpais is a vast area (590 square miles!) in western New Mexico, replete
		with lava fields, tubes, caves and other volcanic features. Many of the lava flows
		are quite young by geological standards, such as McCarty's flow at Lava Falls,
		dated at 3,000 years or less. Older flows of about 115,000 years can be seen in the
		El Calderon area. Because of the lava features' similarity to Hawaiian lava,
		many of the features bear Hawaiian names. In fact, El Malpais has been called
		"the poor man's Hawaii". Because of its
		size, there are numerous activities in which to engage, some planned by the park
		service, and others available to the public year-round. In addition to the hikes
		and scenic drives (partly along the Continental Divide), there are petroglyphs,
		old homesteads, and other cultural sites to explore. Star-gazing events, lectures,
		and Solstice Walks have been sponsored by the Park Service. Back country drives
		are available in good weather, traversing the length of the park - these requiring
		four-wheel drive and sufficient ground clearance.
		<p>El Malpais, located south
		of Grants, New Mexico, is bounded on the east by Highway 117, and on the north and
		west by Highway 53. Adjacent to El Malpais are the Zuni Mountains and also Mt.
		Taylor. Further travel on Highway 117 leads to El Morro National Monument. West of
		the badlands is Ramah Navajo reservation land, and on the east, Acoma reservation
		land.<p>
		Because of the numerous hikes available in the park, a list is provided below
		from which to select and view the options - many of which the authors have not
		yet attempted. As the authors learn more about the area, additional entries to
		the table will be provided, including homestead and petroglyph hikes. The current
		index is far from comprehensive!
		Some of the areas require great care due to the fact that the lava
		is very sharp and difficult to traverse, as well as having the characteristic
		that it can look the same in every direction, making it easy to get lost. A
		GPS system would be advised, depending on where one is hiking. Travel time from
		Corrales is a bit more than 1-1/2 hours, or more, depending on which part of the
		park is being visited. There are numerous online links to visit, and a good place
		to start might be the National Park Service's 
		<a href="https://www.nps.gov/elma/index.htm" target="_blank">El Malpais</a> site.
		Another good reference, providing historical and cultural context is the book
		<em>El Malpais, Mt. Taylor, and the Zuni Mountains</em> by Sherry Robinson.
