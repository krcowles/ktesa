		<p id="hikeInfo">The La Luz Trail is one of the most popular
		and well known hikes to locals. Many, including the authors, make various length hikes
		along its route, and return back to the origin - the Juan Tabo parking area.
		Although the complete trail is long and the elevation change is considerable, it
		is not particularly difficult to hike - it just takes awhile! If ascending to the
		top of the Sandia, a good alternative is to take the Sandia Tram back down to the
		parking lot there, where either a second car awaits, or someone can pick you up.
		Be prepared for the long hike in terms of water and food, and be very mindful of
		weather conditions. Early (or late) in the year, snow storms can pick up, and the
		heights can be snow-covered and icy. The hike is well-covered in detail in the
		<em>Sandia Mountain Hiking Guide</em> by Mike Coltrin, including waypoints. The
		authors have also discovered (though not yet seen) a nearby waterfall, referenced
		in <em>New Mexico Waterfall Handbook</em> by Doug Scott. 
		<a href="http://www.laluztrail.com/" target="_blank">New Mexico Clay</a> has an 
		online link to the trail with conditions, photos, etc. It is also worth noting that
		at about 4 miles up, the La Luz Trail branches to the right, while the Chimney
		Canyon Trail heads left. Both take the hiker to the top - the pictures above are
		from the La Luz Trail. The Chimney Canyon Trail proceeds more quickly to the top
		then travels southward along the crest.
