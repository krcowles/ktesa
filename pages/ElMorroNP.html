	<p id="indxContent">El Morro National Monument is known for its inscriptions of those
	who passed before, as it was located on an ancient east-west trail. It also offered a
	precious commodity - water - and was hence a necessary spot to visit when traveling
	through the area. The rock inscriptions range from those created by ancient Indians 
	to those added by the more modern Spanish Conquistadors. One of the more famous 
	Spaniards is Don Juan Onate, the first
	governor of the territory. Later on, a survey team from the
	Union Pacific Railroad (UPR) passed through and left its mark.<br /><br />
	Owing to the convenient source of water, an ancient pueblo was built on top of the
	towering rock overlooking the pool, and its ruins are now part of the attraction.
	It is unclear how long the
	ruins were in use, and archeologists believe that Indians were living in the area
	prior to building the pueblo. Like many of the southwest ancient ruins, the people
	left somewhere around 1200-1300BC.</p>
