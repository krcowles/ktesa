		<p id="hikeInfo" class="grid_16">Red Rock State Park near Gallup, NM has
		more than one good hiking trail. Pyramid Rock is named for its obvious
		shape, and offers great 360-degree views of the area. The trail has no shade,

		hours from the Albuquerque area, an overnight stay is recommended to fully enjoy
		the park. Other events are held there year-round.</p>
