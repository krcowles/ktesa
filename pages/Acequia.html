		<p id="hikeInfo" class="grid_16">While this hike/walk is local to the Corrales
		area, and can be started almost anywhere along its length, there are some access
		points at the north and south ends. On the north end, from Corrales Road, there
		is a Bosque Parking entrance - a dirt road which terminates a couple of hundred
		yards, near the levee. From there, access is gained to the Bosque, to the levee
		and to the acequia that parallels the acequia. On the south end are parking areas
		along Corrales Road and also just off of Alameda. The south end has some paved
		hiking/running/biking paths as well as levee and acequia access. There is 
		virtually no noticeable elevation gain, and it seems more like a casual and relaxing
		walk as opposed to a hike - but given its length, it can be made a hike of 
		considerable length. This hike/walk is not referenced in any hiking literature,
		but numerous apps do have links: alltrails.com, trails.com, foursquare.com, etc.</p>
