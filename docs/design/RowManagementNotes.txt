Captions and row-sizing

hike.js is the module containing the code that manages image rows, including caption 
display and sizing the rows to fill the page. Note that the code for re-sizing only
occurs when the window is re-sized.

INITIALIZATION:
1.  The margin available between the window frame and document body is calculated and
    made available as a constant. This calculation is done once at page load, so it reveals
    the margin available with the -initial- window size. The minimum body width is 960px, so
    it is possible that the margin available will be negative. The body min-width is held
    in the variable 'minWidth'.
2.  Numerous processing steps must be completed before enabling the row-sizing algorithm.
    To ensure that these steps are completed, a flag 'notInit' is set on page load, and 
    not turned off until initialization is completed.
3.  Since row-sizing is performed whenever the resize event occurs, and that event can
    trigger in very rapid succession, a semaphore is established to allow the code 
    execution to complete before being re-invoked. That semaphore is 'resizeFlag'.
4.  An arbitrary decision was made to allow for 20px of margin on each side of the image
    row when the window shrinks to minWidth. This is called 'triggerWidth'.
5.  When the window resizing is rather small, don't bother recalculating rows. The arbitrary
    value for smallness is held in the  variable 'tooLittle'.
6.  A variable 'unProcSpace' is established to collect multiple undersized resize events,
    and is compared to 'tooLittle' to determine if resizing should occur. Initial value
    is 0.
7.  The last established window frame size is held in 'prevWidth', so that comparisons
    with the size after a resize event can be made to determine whether or not row-sizing
    should occur.
8.  The data pertaining to number of images in each row, and each image's size when the
	page is loaded is held in the arrays 'orgRowCnts[]' (no of images per row), and 
	'orgImgList[]' (image data). When the page shrinks sufficiently, these values are
	easily recalled and restored. This data is also stored in sessionStorage so that when
	a refresh occurs, values can be guaranteed (NOTE: there was a problem with Chrome
	that occurred during page refresh prompting this action). The keyname for the values
	stored in sessionStorage is 'ssdat', hence ssdatImg#_1, ssdatImg#_2, etc.
9.  Behavior is different depending on whether maps are present or not. jQuery is used to
    identify the iframe node, and if not present will set the variable 'mapPresent' to 
    false. Conditional code then calculates where the link below the iframe will appear.
10. Map links (in addition to the iframe link) may appear on the page. These are loaded
    as relative urls (../maps/xyz_geomap.html). These links are reset to point to the
    php-map processing page to display page-appropriate options (see 'mapDisplayOpts').
11. Variables associated with establishing caption pop-up locations and behaviors are
    presented next.
    
    
MAIN ROUTINE EXECUTION:
1.  Processing is contingent upon whether or not the browser supports
    sessionStorage. Most browser do, but if not, the user is alerted so that expectations
    of performance can be established.
2.  Since there is no javascript method to detect when a page refresh occurs, the following
    method was established in attempt to do so (note this code was put in place due to
    unexpected performance on Chrome when executing a page refresh):
    	-- IF Window sessionStorage is supported:
    	a. On initial page load, there will be no pre-defined value stored in sessionStorage
    	   for the variable 'prevLoad'. In that case, the code after the "NORMAL ENTRY" comment
    	   will be executed, which simply captures the incoming data from the page load.
    	   (This code is detailed below: DATA CAPTURE); The statement following the 
    	   conditional test for 'prevLoad' will establish 'prevLoad' after-the-fact.
    	b. If 'prevLoad' exists, then the initial page-loaded data is recovered from
    	   sessionStorage, rather than being re-calculated. This code is listed after the
    	   "REFRESH ENTRY" comment.
    	-- IF Window sessionStorage is NOT supported:
    	a. A message is displayed to the user advising him/her that sessionStorage is not
    	   supported and that page refresh problems may result.
    	b. Page-loaded data is calculated and variables for execution are established.
3.  If an iframe is present, a link for full-page map display is established and placed
    directly below the iframe.
4.  At this point, the 'triggerPoint' is established allowing the image-sizer to know 
	when there is sufficient reason to add an image to the 0th row and size the row 
	accordingly. * NOTE: AVOID CONFUSION WITH var 'triggerWidth'!
    This point has been (arbitrarily) established as the width of the next picture after 
    the end of row0 (i.e. the img width of the first img in row1). When the maxRow width
    exceeds this value, recalculate rows. If there is only one row, skip this step.
5.  Here the var 'triggerWidth' is used to see if resizing of rows is necessary after 
	page load: it is arbitrarily set as body min-width + 40;
6.  Event triggering with respect to images is collected together in a function [eventSet()]
    This is so that the resizer can collectively turn on and off these events while it is
    resizing the rows. At this point in the initial page load, eventSet() can be invoked.
7.  The image sizer needs to know if this is an initial page load, or an resize event.
    The 'initFlag' flag is set to false here so that the routine can differentiate.
8.  Allow resizing to take place by setting 'resizeFlag' to false.

1.  Set up each picture such that when a mouseover event occurs, the cursor changes style
    to indicate to the user that it can be clicked on to go to the photo album directly.
5.  Make sure images have a z-index smaller than the caption z-index (here, z-index=1);
5.  Establish the photo mouseover event to call the function picPop() (turn on caption)
6.  Establish the photo mouseout event to turn off a photo caption
7.  Establish the photo click event to open the corresponding photo album page
    	
DATA CAPTURE FUNCTIONS:
1.  The getOrgDat() function: called on page load (normal entry):
	a. This routine calculates each row's width, and saves the largest in the 'maxRow' 
	   variable. Note that the rows widths will vary by only a few pixels.
	b. Each row's image data is stored in the rowDat[] array: 0 => class/id; 
	   1 => value of class/id; 2 => img height; 3 => img width; 4 => image src.
	   The data is stored in session memory (if supported).
	c. The image data from above is stored in the array 'orgImgList[]' for active use
	   by the sizing routine.
	d. The number of images in each row on page load is stored in the 'orgRowCnts[]' array.
	   *** NOTE: should this be stored in sessionStorage too????
	e. Once the row data is captured and the max row width is known, the 'initMarg' var
	   is calculated to determine how much margin should be maintained between the rows
	   and the border during resizes. (Half of this value at each end). This var is 
	   also stored in sessionStorage for refresh retrieval.
2.  The captureWidths() function: called on page load (normal entry):
	a. Establish the width for each image that has a caption so that the caption will
	   display within the boundaries of the image. The values are stored in the 
	   'capWidth[]' array. If supported, the data is also saved in sessionStorage as
	   'pwidth0', 'pwidth1', etc.
	b. If an iframe is present, capture its position in order to determine where to 
	   place the constructed full-page map link. The critical values 'mapLeft' and 
	   'mapBot' are stored in sessionStorage (if supported) as 'mleft' and 'mbot' 
	   respectively.
3.  The calcPos() function: called on page load (normal entry):
	a. For each photo, establish the top and left position and store in the arrays
	   'capLeft[]' and 'capTop[]'.
	b. Save each of the above in sessionStorage, if supported, as 'ptop0', 'ptop1', ...
	   and 'pleft0', 'pleft1', ...

CAPTION POP-UP FUNCTIONS:
1.  The picPop() function: called when there is a mouseover event on a photo: (id=pic...)
    a. Get the caption from the photo's target pic no. ( desc[picNo] )
    b. Form the caption and location from the target's capWidth, capTop, and capLeft arrays
    c. Place (prepend) the description in the 'popupCap' div on the page
    d. Turn on the display of the div (z-index high enough to appear on top of the photo)
    e. The caption will be removed from the div and its display turned off on mouseout (but
       that is not part of this function)

PROCESSING WINDOW RESIZE EVENTS:

 
	
	WHAT'S IN SESSIONSTORAGE"
	1. 'prevLoad' - needed for refresh detection
	2. 'rowDat' values for each image:  'ssdatImg#_0', 'ssdatImg#_1', etc. stored in 
	   the array: 'orgImgList[]'
	3. 'firstMarg' - initial margin to be used in keeping constant margins on rows for resize
	4. 'ImgCnt' - total number of images
	5. 'row0Count', 'row1Count', etc. : no of images in corresponding row placed in array
	   'orgRowCnts[]'
	6. 'pwidth0', 'pwidth1', etc. (photo widths)
	7. 'mleft' (map left position) and 'mbot' (map bottom position) 
	8. 'ptop0', 'ptop1', ...
	9. 'pleft0', 'pleft1', ...
