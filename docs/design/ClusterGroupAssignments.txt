Cluster Assignments:

NOTE: These started off as a single-character letter, but in preparation for future 
assignments, it seems important to allow for 2 or more characters.


I. Create a New Hike Page:
	A. enterHike.html:
		Select Radio Button [no size attribution at this point]
		Pass to validateHike.php as: name="mstyle" value="cluster"
	B. validateHike.php:
		If $hikeMarker ($_REQUEST['mstyle']) is "cluster" then:
			- Create string of array:  'group$name'  and store in $_SESSION['allTips']
			  NOTE: 'group' is read in from database and is not constrained to a single
			        letter at this point. Each 'group' is tied to a 'name'.
			- Display available names in drop-down box and pass to displayHikePg.php as
			  name="clusgrp" 
			  NOTE: only clusgrp is passed as the selected item (code specifically checks
			        for size of "$clusGrp" and may be larger than 1 char);
			        the string of associations is stored in session memory as 'allTips'
	C. displayHikePg.php:
		If $clusGrp ($_POST['clusgrp']) is not empty:
			NOTE: no size limitation on $clusGrp at this point;
			$clusGrp is passed to saveHike.php in a hidden input name="hclus"
			- Search for  (clusGrp)$  string
			- Get length of above search string
			- Pull in session memory ($_SESSION['allTips'])
			- Find the position in the session memory var for which search string begins
			- Identify the start of the tooltip as right after the search string
			- Get the end of the tooltip string by first stripping off the beginning part
			- Next locate the separator " ; " in the remaining string
			- Extract the tooltip as   $clusTip  (default established as '' earlier)
			- Pass the tooltip to saveHike.php in a hidden input name="htool"
			
	CONCLUSION: No size problems in page creation; sequencing is fine
	
II. Edit a hike page:
	A. hikeEditor.php:
		No assignments at this point; only select a hike to edit
	B. editDB.php:
		Intially, the database is read and the association of group and name is stored
		in array $clusters:   group$name  (NOTE: no size constraints on group)
		The $clusters array is imploded into a string separated by " ; " and stored in
		session memory as $_SESSION['allClusters']. Also stored separately as arrays 
		are all the groups ($groups) and names ($cnames).
		
		The editor displays only the imported group name (if already assigned), and will
		tie the association later in saveChanges.php;
		The selected group name is passed to saveChanges.php as name="htool"
	C. saveChanges.php
		Establish available cluster group assignments ($availLtrs = A-Z, $doubleLtrs = AA-ZZ)
		- Get $clusters = session memory ($_SESSION['allClusters'])
		- Explode as array $clusArray
		- If marker was formerly NOT cluster type, and is now - change type to 'Cluster'
		- If adding a NEW cluster, auto-assign from $availLtrs or $doubleLtrs
		- If group has otherwise changed, get   $passedgrp = $_POST['htool']
		- For each element in $clusArray:
			find the field separator ($) + 1 (beginning of tool name)
			extract the tool name
			compare to the imported name ($passedgrp), if the same:
				extract the corresponding group assignment
				break from the loop
		- Establish the new paramenters for the database
