Automatically add a hike to an Index Page Table during hike page creation.

(At the time of this writing, the new hike already is assigned a marker type of "At VC" 
and the corresponding Index page's 'Cluster String' is updated with the index no of the
new hike, but the corresponding table entry is not automatically generated. It is the 
purpose of this code to correct that situation.)

A. The process begins at enterHike.html, when the radio button for "Hike At / In Close
Proximity to Visitor Center" is selected. The marker type is passed to validateHike.php
as 'mstyle'.
B. If $hikeMarker (imported 'mstyle') is identified as 'ctrhike' in validateHike.php,
   then processing occurs:
	- The database is read and an array is formed from all pages with marker type "Visitor Ctr";
	- The array elements are imploded:  "IndxNo:PageName"
	- The array is used to form a drop-down selection of PageNames, whose value will be
	   IndxNo when passed to displayHikePg.php  The name of the drop-down is 'vcList';
C. If 'vcList' is not empty when received by displayHikePg.php, processing occurs:
	The database is read in, and the last index no is retained, as the new hike will be
	   one greater than this;
	The index no imported ( 'vcList' ) is located in the database, and it's Cluster String
	is updated with the index no. of the new hike-to-be:  indxNo%clusterStr. This string
	is passed to saveHike.php in an input type="hidden" name="hindxstr".
	
	Now the table entry is formed.
	The table entry will consist of 6 pieces of data:
		1. Trail/hike name
		2. Link to web page (hikePageTemplate.php?hikeIndx=NEWHIKENO - from above)
		3. Trail length
		4. Trail elevation change
		5. Exposure icon
		6. Photo link for main album
	    All of this data is available to displayHikePg.php; the new table will be passed
	    to saveHike.php as an array string in session memory.
	The new table entry is formed as an array string, required by index page hike tables,
	and is either appended to the existing hike, or if nothing was there before, becomes
	the new table. The new string is stored in $_SESSION['indxTbl'] and passed on to 
	saveHike.php
D. In saveHike.php, if the imported cluster string ( $_POST['hindxstr'] is NOT empty, then
   process the page:
   	Read in the entire database ($wholeDB)
   	Extract the line containing the index-page-to-update ( $_POST['hindxpg'] )
