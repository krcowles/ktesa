--- MARKER & INFO-WINDOW GROUPINGS - PROPOSED:

1. VISITOR CENTER

NOTE: "Visitor Center" markers will apply to National, State, or Private Parks or Monuments
      where there is a public building with facilities and park information and/or rangers
      or other official park representatives:
      	e.g.  Bandelier National Monument
      		  Rio Grande Nature Center State Park
      		  Ghost Ranch
      		  El Malpais Ranger Station
      		  
      "Visitor Centers" will have 0, 1, or many hikes originating at the center (within
      easy walking distance or very short drive). By definition, these will be referred
      to as "originating hikes". All "Visitor Center" locations are
      identified with a green marker pin on the map. The tooltip will display the
      visitor center name.
      
      "Visitor Centers" will have a separate park information page with a park map, information
      about the park (summary), and links to further information about the park on the web.
      The park information page will include a table of hikes associated with the park,
      whether they are in near proximity or remote from the visitor center.
