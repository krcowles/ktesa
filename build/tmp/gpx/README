This subdirectory is used to temporarily store gpx (XML) files
submitted by the user during the new hike page creation process.

The files will be moved either:
	1. By the site master during saveHike.php execution,
	   after entering the site master password, or
	2. Later, after review by the site master, when data is
	   submitted by a registered user.
