UPDATED 7/14/2017 – only GPX file is needed, and there is a ‘noPics’ option

    Except for cases where code is shared with run-time code, the [project]/build 
directory contains various scripts required to build and edit hike pages and 
index pages for the site.  The following activities can be performed with the 
scripts in this directory:
    1.  Create a new hike page
    2.  Create a new index page
    3.  Edit a hike page
    4.  Edit an index page
    5.  Delete a hike page

    The scripts are designed such that two types of users are expected to deploy
them: the site masters (Tom Sandberg and Ken Cowles), and ‘registered users’ 
(an option not yet fully specified but expected to accommodate outside users 
who wish to maintain/enter their own relevant hikes after potential review and 
acceptance by the site masters). Site masters will make changes directly to 
the file system and database, whereas registered users will have changes stored
in temporary directories and in a temporary database, pending review by the 
site masters. The site masters will review the entries and move them into the 
site if accepted, deleting the temporary data. (NOTE: This process has not 
yet been defined and documented by the site masters, and the description here 
is purely speculative).

    To invoke any of the above processes, the ‘registered user key’ must be 
entered into the main site page (index.html). When entered, the available 
options will appear and be enabled.

 I. CREATING A NEW HIKE PAGE
    To begin the process of creating a new hike page for the site, the user
    should be prepared with the appropriate data required:
    A. Total Hike Length (in miles), whether loop, out-and-back, or two-car hike;
    B. The elevation change (in feet), from min to max, experienced on the hike;
    C. Available GPX file (xml file with GPS data) of the actual track taken on
       the hike, using any appropriate device or phone app: e.g. "EndoMondo"
       (phone app), Garmin GPS Handheld, etc. The file should be accessible from
       the users local machine;
    D. Google maps direction link to trailhead;
    E. Photo album link(s) to on-line photos taken during the hike (e.g. Flickr, 
       Google, etc). Note, these should contain GPS metadata in order to be
       displayed on the hike map.
    F. References: Book/Author containing trail descriptions (and/or other 
       info pertinent to the hike); Weblinks to site about the hike; App links,
       Blogs, On-line Newslinks, etc with significant or interesting info about
       the hike;
    G. Other prompted information (some optional):
        - Hike/Trail Name: 
            NOTE Script must encode special html characters (e.g. &, <, >)
        - Locale: select from a drop-down. Missing one? Notify site master...
        - Hike "Type": logistics, i.e. Out-and-back, Loop, Two-car (select from
            drop-down)
        - Relative difficulty: select from a drop-down
        - Facilities available at trailhead, if any
        - WOW Factor - what makes this hike special in a word or two
        - What seasons are best or should be avoided?

        - Any other GPX or MAP files you wish to appear on the page (see "L." below)
        - Any other images you wish to include with the photos (may be on your
          local machine)
    H. Select Exposure: select a radio button corresponding to conditions
    I. Hike relative to other hikes on the site: select a radio button
       corresponding to the set-up: e.g. "trailhead common to multiple hikes",
       "hike at Visitor Center", etc.
    J. OPTIONAL: Trail Tips: any warnings, special circumstances about the hike
       that the hiker should be aware of prior to embarking.
    K. Hike Description: In your own words, describe the hike, locale, views, 
       special features of the hike.
    L. OPTIONAL: enter/label any extra data of interest, such as Proposed Routes,
       Alternate Maps, etc. in the "GPS Maps & Data" section.

    NOTE: Any hike data entered may be saved until you return to complete it 
    later, by selecting the 'Save Form Data' button. You will be prompted to give
    it a name. This action adds a button to the bottom of the page allowing you
    to either restore the data (except for any uploaded files - e.g. GPX), or to
    delete the saved form. This button will remain active until you explicitly
    delete it, and there is only room for two such buttons at this time. It
    resides in your browser's memory until you delete it.

    ** STYLING **
    enterHike.css contains styling for the enterHike.html form, described below.
    Note the browser-dependent code for enlarging the check boxes on the page.
    Included is some styling for the accompanying modal window.

    ** JAVASCRIPT **
    The enterHike.html script, containing the entry form, calls up two javascript
    files: modal_setup.js and enterHike.js. 
        - modal_setup.js contains the code for the modal window that appears
          when you wish to save form data, along with code supporting the form
          save process.
        - enterHike.js contains the code to accomplish multiple tasks:
            1. Preload a file name into the corresponding "GPS Maps & Data"
               section when a file is uploaded in the "File Data" section. The
               option "maps" or "gpx" in the adjacent "Storage Location" 
               drop-down will properly locate the file. Then the user need only 
               to supply the labeling information in the GPS Maps & Data section.
            2. Suppress text boxes for entry of latitude/longitude unless an
               Index Page is being created (needed for location of Visitor Center).
            3. Select the appropriate action for form submittal based on whether
               the radio button for "CREATE A NEW: Visitor Center/Index Page" or
               "CREATE A NEW: Hike Page" is selected at the top of the form.
               This will also gray out data not required when Index Page is 
               selected and modify some other form presentation.
            4. Fill in 'placeholder' information in the References section,
               depending on Reference Type selected from the accompanying
               drop-down box.
            5. Toggle displays for items not needed when "I don't want to specify
               pictures at this time" is selected.
            6. IF form data has been previously saved, include the item(s)
               retained in browser memory, and provide a means for restoring
               if a button is selected, and a means for deleting and removing
               from browser memory if that is selected. Code is provided for
               activating the modal window if "Save Form Data" is selected.
    ** HTML/FORM **
    The form, with inputs for the above-listed information, is invoked from the
    main page by selecting the 'Create New Hike or Index Page' button. The
    registration code is currently set as '1948'. The form html is contained in 
    'enterHike.html'. There is no php in this file, only form elements to submit
    containing the data required to construct a page in the following scripts.
    As noted above, up to two partially-filled forms may be saved in memory, to
    be restored at any time in the future. When the 'Validate Data' button is
    selected, the form calls 'validateHike.php'.

    ** VALIDATION.PHP **
